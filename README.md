<h3>Eglo Splitting Invoice</h3>
<h5>This app is made for the professional needs of Eglo Lighting Company in Serbia.</h5>
Every week when the office in Serbia receives one big invoice for the next delivery, 
articles must be imported to the company's software and a specific sale invoice must be created for each customer. 
To this date, this was done by typing the article numbers and quantities manually. 
From now on, the app extracts necessary details (item numbers, quantities..) from the original invoice, and creates a new Excel file for each customer, 
based on a customer number. Those excel files are then ready to be imported into the company's software. This way, sales invoices are created with just a few clicks.
